# Color-CPP
A semi multiplattform color C++ library for the terminal.<br /><br /><br />

## Important Notice
**This library is coded only for C++, it won't work with C** (Maybe were will be a C version in the future)<br /><br /><br />

## How to use
Just download the [ZIP-File](https://github.com/mrehfeld-code/Color-CPP/raw/main/color.zip) (`/color.zip`) and unzip it in the directory of your project or if you're using Linux or MacOS copy it to the following directories to use the headers system wide:
* for Linux: `/usr/include/`
* for MacOS: `/usr/local/include/` 
<br /><br />


after that you can use (if it's in the projects directory) the following to include main header: 
```cpp
#include "color/color.h"
```
or if it's in the systems header directory:
```cpp
#include <color/color.h>
```
